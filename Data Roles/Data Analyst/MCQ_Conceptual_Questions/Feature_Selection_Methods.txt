QUESTION:
What are the feature selection methods used to select the right variables?


SOLUTION:

There are two main methods for feature selection, i.e, filter, and wrapper methods.

Filter Methods:
-Linear discrimination analysis
-ANOVA
-Chi-Square

The best analogy for selecting features is "bad data in, bad answer out." When we're limiting or selecting the features, it's all about cleaning up the data coming in. 

Wrapper Methods:

-Forward Selection: We test one feature at a time and keep adding them until we get a good fit
-Backward Selection: We test all the features and start removing them to see what works better
-Recursive Feature Elimination: Recursively looks through all the different features and how they pair together

Wrapper methods are very labor-intensive, and high-end computers are needed if a lot of data analysis is performed with the wrapper method.
