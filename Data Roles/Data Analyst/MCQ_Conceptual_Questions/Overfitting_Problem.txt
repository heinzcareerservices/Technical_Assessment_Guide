QUESTION:
How can you avoid overfitting your model?

ANSWER:
Overfitting refers to a model that is only set for a very small amount of data and ignores the bigger picture. There are three main methods to avoid overfitting:

1. Keep the model simpleâ€”take fewer variables into account, thereby removing some of the noise in the training data
2. Use cross-validation techniques, such as k folds cross-validation 
3. Use regularization techniques, such as LASSO, that penalize certain model parameters if they're likely to cause overfitting
