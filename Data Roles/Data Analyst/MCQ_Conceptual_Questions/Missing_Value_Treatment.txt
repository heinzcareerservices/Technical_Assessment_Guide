QUESTION:
Which of the following machine learning algorithms can be used for inputting missing values of both categorical and continuous variables?


ANSWER:
1. K-means clustering
2. Linear regression 
3. K-NN (k-nearest neighbor)

Decision trees 
The K nearest neighbor algorithm can be used because it can compute the nearest neighbor and if it doesn't have a value, it just computes the nearest neighbor based on all the other features. 

When you're dealing with K-means clustering or linear regression, you need to do that in your pre-processing, otherwise, they'll crash. Decision trees also have the same problem, although there is some variance.
