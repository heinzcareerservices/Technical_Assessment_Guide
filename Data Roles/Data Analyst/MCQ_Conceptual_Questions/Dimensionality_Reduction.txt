QUESTION:
What are dimensionality reduction and its benefits?


ANSWER:
The Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of converting a data set with vast dimensions into data with fewer dimensions (fields) to convey similar information concisely. 

This reduction helps in compressing data and reducing storage space. It also reduces computation time as fewer dimensions lead to less computing. It removes redundant features;
for example, there's no point in storing a value in two different units (meters and inches).
