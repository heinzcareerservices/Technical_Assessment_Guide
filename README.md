# Technical_Assessment_Guide
**TL;DR :** Capturing the function-wise pattern of questions typically asked in written technical assessments


   **Resource Objective**
The objective of the project is to create a structured online repository of the questions that are typically asked in technical written assessments.

Technical written assessments are generally the first phase of screening tests that are conducted by employers to evaluate the technical/analytical aptitude and proficiency of candidates. All assessments are conducted virtually, are timed and also proctored. 

The nature & pattern of the technical test varies from company-to-company, and from role-to-role.
